## RStudio 1.4 "Juliet Rose" Release Notes


### Misc

* Added support for the `|>` pipe operator, and `\(x)` function shorthand syntax (#8543)
* Added preference toggle for inserting the |> pipe operator when the Insert Pipe Operator command is used (#8534)

### RStudio Server

* **BREAKING:** RStudio when served via `http` erroneously reported its own address as `https` during redirects if the header `X-Forwarded-Proto` was defined by a proxy. That could lead to a confusing proxy setup. That has been fixed, but existing proxy installations with redirect rewite settings matching for `https` may have to be adjusted.
